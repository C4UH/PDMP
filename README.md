PDMP Acceleration Tools for Pharmacy Boards, Hospitals &amp; Physicians

We're very grateful to and pleased to acknowlege the program that sparked our
"innovation in simplicity" - http://www.healthit.gov/pdmp/PDMPConnect/Pilots 

Using Patient Admit/Schedule Trigger as the Go Button, we return PDMP Reports
right into the provider's Certified EHR.  Or, the Reports can also push to a
secure folder on a tablet or smart phone.  

The trigger launches a CONNECT HIE (query mode) transaction to acquire each
PDMP Report in real time.  The Report itself returns via Direct Project (push mode)
secure messaging, and is automatically deposited into the EHR.

The intention was always to offer a "Swiss Army Knife" kind of toolset to help the
rural and underserved communities, and others who might find their own advantage in 
this type of method.  As a result, we architected the solution to serve ANY need that
a provider and a state or federal agency might have to exchange some data.  It also
turns out that this works perfectly well for any two providers, not otherwise connected,
who wish to collaborate in care on a specific patient or community of patients.

FAQ #1 - isn't C4UH just another HIE?
Answer - Not at all.  We have NO Man In The Middle here.  Each member user has full
control of when, who and what, for ALL interactions.  Members are, in effect, acting
as "their own HIE" in any use of C4UH tools and services.

However, we expect that, over time, 
many HIE vendors/sponsors and large provider systems seeking to create Clinical Data Repositories
and Big Data Warehouses will come to know our project as "my best friend for integration."
Why?  With baked in full compliance for CONNECT Open Source, Direct Project, HL7, IHE, CDA,
C-CDA, CCR, and PDF/healthcare, the broader community will realize that one quick and simple
method to "just integrate now" with radically reduced initial and sustaining costs will
remove/reduce many barriers and speed adoption and collaboration.

Clearly, we are all ready, as members of the global health community, to have a few things
that are simpler, easier, and less costly.  C4UH hopes to provide One Good Thing that
helps all stakeholders move more efficiently towards that elusive bulls-eye.
