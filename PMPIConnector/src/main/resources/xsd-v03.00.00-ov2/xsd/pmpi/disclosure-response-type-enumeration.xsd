            The search was processed by the PMP and the disclosure is
            enclosed.  
            
            The PMP system MUST provide a pmpi:EncryptedData element.
            The encrypted contents of that element MUST validate against
            pmp:RequestResponsePrescriptionReport from the PMIX NIEM
            IEPD dated

            The pmpi:PlaintextData element WILL NOT be present.

          <xsd:documentation>
            The PMP system received the search request but it cannot process the
            request within the time allotted within a synchronous request so the
            PMP from which disclosure is sought is deferring its response. 
            
            The pmpi:EncryptedData element MUST NOT be present.

            When a PMP defers its response it SHOULD provide a value
            detailing the deferral reason via pmpi:PlaintextData. 
            
            Searching PMPs that cannot process deferred responses should
            ensure that they cancel the deferred request by configuring
            the PMP to autocancel in the Interconnect console or by
            implementing autocancel themselves by immediately invoking
            the cancel operation when a deferred response type is
            received.  If autocancel is implemented in the console the
            message provided in the console will be appended to any
            message received from the PMP.

            The search was disallowed per one of the business rules
            specified within Interconnect.  As such Interconnect
            disallowed the search which was not fowarded to the PMP
            system from which disclosure was sought.
